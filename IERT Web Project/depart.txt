  <h3>Biotechnology</h3>
<hr style="border: 1px solid #ADD8E6;">
<b>Department Mission: </b>
<br>
<br>
 To generate high quality engineering professionals by offering UG (B.Tech.) and PG (M.Tech. and Ph.D.) programmes in Biotechnology and to develop a premier biotechnology teaching and research department to cater the needs and challenges of the region and the country.
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Department Vision:</b>
 <br>
 <br>
 The biotechnology program vision is to provide quality teaching with a strong core science concepts and an application-oriented undergraduate and post-graduate education along with solid foundation in the rapidly expanding fields of biotechnology that enable them to produce high quality professionals. Our goal is to provide students with a sound knowledge and understanding of current theories, concepts and laboratory practices in biotechnology.

 <b>About the Department:</b>
 <br>
 Biotechnology at MNNIT Allahabad was established as a new academic unit under Applied Mechanics in 2006, with the objective of integrating life sciences with engineering and to develop cutting-edge technology through research, training and technological innovation.Initially as a part of the Department of Applied Mechanics, an administratively independent Department of Biotechnology was established in the April, 2012. Since its inception, the department has witnessed a consistent rise in the students demand for the subject. Keeping a beat to the global demands for researchers in this field, a full-fledged post graduate degree course (M. Tech) in Biotechnology was introduced in the year 2010. The department has also started a PhD program in biotechnology since 2009.
<br>
The department is well equipped with the all necessary instruments and number of research facilities. The department has a young, enthusiastic and well qualified faculty actively involved in research and teaching. The teachers are available to the students for academic as well as personal counseling. The department has been encouraging the students to independently think as well as implement research ideas.Presently, B. Tech, M. Tech (Biotechnology) and PhD program is being run under Biotechnology with the involvement of thirteen faculty members.
